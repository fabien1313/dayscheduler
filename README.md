# dayscheduler

## Description

This repository hosts a Workday Scheduler. This program will cover normal business hours between 9am-5pm. The time slots are colored to represent the time tense (past = "grey", present = "red", and future = "green"). The time is implemented at the top of the page and is automatically updated so it moves with you as you create a schedule for the day.

Localstorage has also been implemented so you can insert comments and save them or remove them as you choose. When exiting the program or coming back later the information will persists as long as you wish it to.
